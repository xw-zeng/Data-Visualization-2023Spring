An invasive species of crossbred "super pigs" from Canada could eventually become an issue for the United States and experts are continuously sounding the alarm while monitoring the situation.
Wild pigs have plagued southern states in the U.S. for decades now, according to the Smithsonian Magazine, with the animals destroying crops, killing native species while being a walking petri dish of diseases that can spread to humans.
Those pigs reportedly stick to warmer climates like Florida and Texas but still have managed to cause an estimated $2.1 billion in damages annually, according to Texas Parks and Wildlife.
Now, according to experts, a breed of wild cross-bred "super pigs" threaten northern U.S. states with the same woes.
Those "super pigs" are reportedly a crossbreed of domesticated and wild swine, who are larger, hairier, smarter and boast quick and fruitful reproductive qualities alongside a lack of natural predators.
In February, Brook told The Guardian that he believes the pig problem in Canada is now too big to completely get rid of anymore.
That's a problem the U.S. could soon face as well, experts reportedly add, with Michael Marlow, assistant program manager for the Department of Agricultureâ€™s national feral swine damage management program, warning that the wild pigs negatively affect native species in the areas they invade.
Some have attempted to quell wild pig populations through the use of poison, however some attempts have been unsuccessful. Brook himself suggested to The New York Post that "large traps and tracking Judas pigs (wild pigs with a GPS collar that will lead you to other pigs), ground removal teams, fencing, and education are all key."
